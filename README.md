# Whatever Floats Your Boat

This game was our entry in to Boise State University's 2019 annual 7 Hour Game Jam- known as the 'GIMM Jam'. GIMM is an acronym for Games Interactive Media and Mobile, my B.S. We developed a game in which the player controls an employee of a root beer float stand on a seaside pier. Your customers are an eccentric bunch who have strange float requests, but you fulfill them without judgement. We have cute ice cream and soda flavors like poop, sea water, tar and pee. This game even featured an original score.
